# Statistical-Inference-Course-Project

This report is for the final course project for the Statistical Inference course, part of the John Hopkins Statistics and Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera.

The project had 2 parts:
Part 1: 
Analyze the exponential distribution in R (rexp(n, lambda) with lambda = 0.2) 
and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem.
The properties of the expression are as follows: Lambda = 0.2; Expected Mean = 1/Lambda
= 5; Expected Standard Deviation = 1/Lambda = 5; Expected Variance = 25


Part 2:
Analyze the ToothGrowth dataset in R.
